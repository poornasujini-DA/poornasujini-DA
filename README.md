## 👩‍💼 About Me
👋 Hi, I’m @poornasujini

I am a dedicated Data Analyst with 2.5 years of experience specializing in statistical analysis and data visualization.
My journey has been enriched by a Nanodegree from Code First Girls, six months of intensive Data Science training, and real-time experience at Innodatatics Inc. as a Data Developer. 
Here, I honed my skills in machine learning algorithms, data analysis, and project implementation, including the development of airfare prediction models using time series analysis.

My professional goal is to drive data-driven decision-making and provide actionable insights to foster business growth.
💞️ I am eager to secure a position as a Junior Data Analyst or an apprenticeship where I can address client challenges and further develop my skills.
